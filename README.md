# ProjectSprigotito

This project is to create an AI model to control a new Pok√©mon species called Sprigatito.
More specifically, by using existing AI modeling methods based on neuroengineering, or by using methods completely different from them, we will eventually be able to read human emotions and behaviors over the very long term and raise the standard of living. The goal is to create a model that works.
